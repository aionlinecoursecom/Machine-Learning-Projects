### **2. [Insurance Pricing Forecast Using XGBoost Regressor](https://www.aionlinecourse.com/ai-projects/playground/insurance-pricing-forecast-using-xgboost-regressor)**

#### **Project Overview**
This project focuses on using the **XGBoost Regressor** to predict healthcare expenses for insurance companies. By accurately forecasting costs based on factors like age, BMI, and smoking status, insurance companies can set profitable premiums and improve coverage.

For more details, visit the **[Insurance Pricing Forecast Project](https://www.aionlinecourse.com/ai-projects/playground/insurance-pricing-forecast-using-xgboost-regressor)** on **[Ai-projects](https://www.aionlinecourse.com/ai-projects)**.

#### **Key Features Include**
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, transforming, and encoding features like age, smoking status, and region.
- **Model Development**: Building a baseline linear regression model, followed by the more advanced XGBoost Regressor.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Evaluating models using metrics like RMSE, MAPE, and R-squared to assess accuracy.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing the XGBoost model using Bayesian Optimization for better performance.

#### **Project Outcome**
The XGBoost Regressor outperformed linear regression, offering a more accurate prediction model. This approach helps insurance companies set reliable premiums based on predicted healthcare costs, improving profitability and operational efficiency.
